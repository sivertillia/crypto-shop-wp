============================================================================

This plugin implements the Canna Paid Payments API, and specifically, the plugin embed feature, to allow customers to make payments with Visa and Mastercard (AMEX and Discover are not currently supported. Stay tuned!).

Canna Paid is different than other processing gateways because customers purchase a stable token in the process of making their payment. The stable token is then converted into $USD, and settlement with the merchant occurs 4-6 days from the time of the transaction.

All of our merchants will have access to a real-time dashboard to view their payments and daily settlements.
