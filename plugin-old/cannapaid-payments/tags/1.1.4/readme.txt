============================================================================

This plugin implements the CPG Payments API, specifically the plugin embed feature, to allow customers to make payments with Visa and Mastercard (AMEX and Discover are not currently supported. Stay tuned!).

CPG Payments is different than other processing gateways because customers purchase a stable token in the process of making their payment. The stable token is then converted into $USD, and settlement occurs 4-6 business days from the time of the transaction.

Our merchants have access to a real-time dashboard to view their payments and daily settlements.
