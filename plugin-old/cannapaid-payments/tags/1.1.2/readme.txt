============================================================================

This plugin implements the Cannapaid Payments API, and specifically, the
plugin embed feature, to allow customers to make payments with Visa, 
Mastercard and Discover cards (AMEX not currently supported, stay tuned!).

What makes this plugin different compared to other payment processing
gateways is that customers purchase a crypto-currency in the process of
making their payment, and the merchant gets paid in crypto (typically within
24 hours).

This process of instantly converting payments to crypto allows for
unprecedented speeds in cash settlements to merchants, and with the money
available instantly, merchants have the liquidity needed to grow their
business faster, especially when working with international suppliers,
factories and drop-ship partners.

Merchants get access to a real-time dashboard to view their payments and
daily settlements.
